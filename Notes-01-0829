---- There are lots of ways to describe computer science.
---- Most computer science programs are directed more towards computer architecture (theoretical).
---- Our outcomes are directed specifically at programming (practical).

---- HW - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9dwGZ6yY0k
* Note: We are using Python 3.6.
---- There are "two" versions of Python, known as Python 2 and Python 3.
---- I believe that the future is in Python 3, though lots of people use Python 2.
