Turtle Racing
* This is the first substantial piece of code that you're going to look at.
* This involves ideas and commands that you have not yet seen.
* Run the code a few times so students can see what happens.

Breaking down the code
* This code is written rather poorly. It is not a model for what good code should look like. (More later)
* Here are the features for students to notice:
---- Comments: Comments are introduced with # and is text to help humans read the code
---->> Multiline comments can be created using ''' to start and stop it.
---- Variables: Variables are containers that hold values
---->> Discuss variable naming, variable naming, and math (+, -, *, /, **, %)
---- Relational operators: These are symbols that tell Python to compare objects
---->> Here are the main relational operators: ==, >, >=, <, <=
---- Loops: These are pieces of code that might be repeated
---->> Loops will show up in the Sentdex tutorials soon
---->> Use flowcharts to demonstrate how these work
---->> Discuss both for loops and while loops
---- If/Elif/Else: This is part of "flow control" and is part of helping the computer make decisions
---->> Do some examples of this with relational operators
---- Note: Under the surface, there are boolean variables and boolean operators, but we won't talk about those now
* The code has four parts. Have students try to read through the code and figure out what each part does.

Clean code
* This is a topic usually done quite a bit later, but it's worth talking about now.
* The idea of clean code is that there are good ways to write code and there are bad ways.
* Most people at the early level focus on little things like indentation (which Python forces you to do) and visual aspects like that.
* But clean code is much deeper, and goes to the core of software engineering.
* Clean code is code that works and is easy to follow.
* It comes down to writing things in a manner that "make sense."
* We will be introduced to functions shortly, but the idea of a function is that it's kind of a mini-program inside a larger program.
* By doing things this way, programs can be expressed in a simpler manner: drawTrack(), countdown(), moveTurtle(), etc.
* Notice the close connection between a flowchart and clean coding.
