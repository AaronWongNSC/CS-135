Numbers
* We have primarily been working with integers.
* In Python, integers are a certain "type" of object.
---- type(10) gives that 10 is an integer.
* The number 10.0 is a floating point number.

Floating Point Numbers
* Floating point numbers are decimals with finite precision.
* Try evaluating .1+.2 in Python.
---- This happens because of how numbers are stored.
---- Since computers operate in binary, decimals are actually stored as sums of binary fractions.

Binary numbers
* Before talking about binary fractions, we should talk about binary numbers.
* We already got a taste of binary numbers when doing the binary addition, but we should take a closer look
* The number system we use is the base-10 system, and it's named that way because each place value corresponds to a power of 10.
* Binary is base-2, and each place value corresponds to a power of 2. Furthermore, the digits must all be 0 or 1.
---- Convert 73 to binary by pulling out the largest power of 2 and subtracting.

Binary decimals
* The same idea holds true with binary decimals, except that we're taking out reciprocals of powers of 2.
---- This gives us decimals of 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, etc to work with
---->> When combined, we will end up with a fraction of the form J/2**N for some N.
---- It is impossible to write 0.1 as a finite sum of these decimals, so we only get an approximation.
* The precise details for how floating point numbers work is technical enough that it doesn't matter for this class.
* The important thing to remember is that almost none of the decimals you see are exact, and that rounding error must be considered
---- For example, .1 + .2 == .3 is FALSE

Coin flipping
* Over the next several classes, we're going to be writing a coin flip simulation/analysis tool.
* We will start off by practicing using list manipulation to append values onto a list
* Create a program that asks for a number of coin flips, and then produces a random list of 0s and 1s of the indicated length.
---- Start with an empty list, write a loop, and then append values to the list
