Prime Numbers
* Discuss the prime number assignment
* Allow the class the chance to develop a flow chart for prime testing
* Convert that flow chart into a program
---- The output of the program should state whether the number is prime or composite.

More about printing
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print%20sep#print
---- sep and end are two important parameters to control when trying to manage output
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html
---- Usage of {} and .format together in creating strings to print
---- {x:n} prints the x-th position in a space of at least n characters
---- d is for integers, f is for decimals, and .3f prints 3 decimals.

Write a factor-finding program
* This is conceptually similar to the prime-finding program
* The output should list the factors (separated by a couple spaces) in a sentence:
---- "The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18"
* Note: This should be done without lists.
