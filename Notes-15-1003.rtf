Hacking
* The verb "to hack" means to shape with rough strokes.
* The idea is that of "hacking togehter" (which is the same usage as "life hack").
* In programming, it's the idea of being able start with a piece of code and modify it to fit your desired outcome.

pyplot from matplotlib
* This is a graphing package that you saw in the last few sentdex videos.
* It is an incredibly powerful program, but it is easy to be overwhelmed by it
* Navigating the documentation is not easy, as it assumes you understand a lot of things that you might not know about
* This makes hacking a better approach, because you start to learn the bits and pieces you need
* But if you want to understand it more deeply, sentdex has a tutorial on just matplotlib

Pie Chart
* We will create a pie chart to represent the percent occurrences of 00, 01, 10, and 11 from the coin flip simulations.
* Code snippet: https://github.com/AaronWongNSC/CS-135/blob/master/pyplot-01-Pie%20Chart.py
* Figure out what is doing what, and modify it to work with the data you can generate from the simulation

Line Chart
* We want to create a line chart that shows balance of 0s and 1s (1 = up one step, 0 = down one step)
* Convert the list of results into a list that can be graphed
* Code snippet: https://github.com/AaronWongNSC/CS-135/blob/master/pyplot-02-Line%20Chart.py

Random Walks
* The last graph is a demonstration of a very important mathematical concept.
* A random walk is a graph generated by this process of a random result leading to a movement in a particular direction
---- Random walks can be in two dimensions, on a grid, on a graph, with a continuous variable...
* This type of graph is not that different from graphs of important real-world data, such as the stock market
* This is also used for understanding probability-driven events, such as gambling
---- We can think of this graph as representing winning $1 or losing $1 based on the outcome of the coin flip
* We can also detect fraud when random data suddenly appears to be not-so-random
---- We saw this when we manually created long lists for the coin-flipping analysis
* In a probability/statistics course, you will encounter random walks and learn some of the math behind it.
