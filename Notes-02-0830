Review Turtle homework

Multiple turtles:
* You can create multiple turtles as long as you give them different names.

Turtle documentation:
* https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/turtle.html
---- Spend 5-10 minutes allowing students to play with the commands. Try both turtle and window commands.
---- Notice that the commands are of the form turtle.something. The something is known as a method, and it is applied to a turtle.

Importing modules
* Multiple forms:
---- import module
---->> This format means that anything you call will be of the form module.something
---- import module as name
---->> This allows you to refer to module using a shorter name. A common one is "import matplotlib as plt"
---- from module import *
---->> This imports the module but you do not need to use module.something.
---->> If you replace * with a specific command, it will only import that specific command
---->> You use this when you need to worry about conflicts between commands or if you're short on memory.

Other modules that are good to know about:
* numpy - This is a package that allows you to make/use mathematical arrays.
* pandas - This is a data analysis module
* matplotlib - This is used for making plots and other graphing
* scikit-learn - This is an artificial intelligence and machine learning module
* pygame - This is a module that helps you to make games
* random - This allows you to generate random numbers
* time - This gives you access to measure time

Finding tutorials:
* Python is a very open-information community. This means that almost everything has a tutorial somewhere.
* Different tutotrials may have different ways of doing things, and different perspectives.
* The reason we discussed how modules are imported is because you will need to understand the difference when you read tutorials.

Sorting discussion
* Suppose I give you a shuffled deck of cards and your task is to put it back in order. How will you do it?
* Create flow charts to describe the different methods.
* Try to translate how this might look to a computer.
